                        Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures 
                        and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. With its elegant syntax and dynamic 
                        typing, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This tutorial introduces informally to the basic conceps and featrues of the Python language and system. It helps to have
                        a Python interpreter handy for hands-on experience, but all examples are self-contained, so the tutorial can be read offline
                        as well.

                        If you do much work on computers, you find that there's some task you'd like to automate. For example,
                        you may wish to perform a search-and-replace over a large number of files, or rename and/or rearrange a bunch of photo files.
                        Maybe you'd like to write a small custom database, or a specialized GUI application, or a simple game. Python is the language for you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You could write a Unix shell script to do some of these tasks, but its not well suited for GUI applications or games. You could write a
                        program in another language, but it can take a lot of development time to get the first-draft program. Python is simpler to use, available 
                        in all operating systems, and will get the job done more quickly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The programming language isn't named after snakes, it's named after the BBC show "Monty Python's Flying Cirucs", so references to the
                        show and Monty Python in the documentation is the norm.

                    <header>Using the Python Interpreter</header>
                    <p>
                        To start typing code in Python, download it from the official page, and execute the Interpreter by typing in the command shell:
                    </p>
                    <div class="code-box"><code>python3.11</code></div>
                    <p>
                        The interpreter's line-editing features include interactive editing, history subsition and code completion on systmes that support the GNU Readline
                        library. The interpreter operates similar to the Unix shell: when called with standard input connected to a tty device, it reads and executes commands
                        interactively; when called with a file name argument or with a file as standart input, it reads and executes a script from that file.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When commands are read from a tty, the interpreter is said to be in interactive mode. In this mode it prompts for the next command with the primary 
                        prompt (>>>); for continuation lines it prompts with the secondary prompt (...).

                        Lets continue with some Python commands. You can use the interpreter as a calculator. Use expression syntax like +,-,* and / to make mathematical 
                        operations. You can also use parentheses for grouping

                        To create a variable, use the equal sign (=), no result is displayed before the next interactive prompt.

                    <p>
                        We can use Python for more complicated tasks than adding two and two. For example, we can write an sub-sequence of the Fibonacci series 
                        (the sume of two elements defines the next) as follows:
                    </p>
                    <div class="code-box">
                        <code>
                        >>> a, b = 0, 1<br>
                        >>> while a < 10:<br>
                        ... <span class="code-indent"></span>(a)<br>
                        ... <span class="code-indent"></span>a, b = b, a+b
                        </code>
                    </div>
                    <p>This example introduces several new features.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The first line contanins a multiple assignment: the variables a and b simultaneously get the new values 0 and 1. On the last line
                            it is used again, demostrating that the expression on the right-hand side are all evaluated first before any of the assignments
                            take place. The right-hand side expressions are evaluated from the left to the right.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The while loop executes as long as the condition (there: a < 10) remains true. In Python, any non-zero integer value is true: zero
                            is false. In fact, any sequence; anything with a non-zero lenght is true, empty sequences are false. The comparasion operators are:
                            <ul>
                                <li>< (less than)</li>
                                <li>> (greater than)</li>
                                <li>== (equalt to)</li>
                                <li><= (less than or equal to)</li>
                                <li>>= (greater than or equal to)</li>
                                <li>!= (not equal to)</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The body of the loop is indented. Indendation is Python's way of grouping statements. At the interactive prompt, you have to type a
                            tab or space(s) for each indented line. In a decent text editor it will have an auto-indent facility. Note that each line within a
                            basic block must be indented by the same amount.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                        The for statement in Python works differently from other programming languages, Python's for statement iterates over the items of any sequence
                        (a list of a string), in the order that they appear in the sequence.
